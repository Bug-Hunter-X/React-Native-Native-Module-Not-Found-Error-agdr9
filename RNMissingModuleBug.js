This error occurs when using a library that's not properly linked or configured within your React Native project. It often manifests as a runtime error, indicating that the native module is missing or inaccessible.  The exact message might vary depending on the library and platform (Android or iOS).  You'll commonly see variations of "Native module cannot be found",  "Module RCTBridgeModule not found", or other messages indicating a missing or improperly linked native component.
